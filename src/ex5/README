the two main RegEx expressions we used were:
1. NAME = "([a-zA-Z]|_[a-zA-Z0-9])\\w*"
this regex includes in it all possible name compositions, i.e. letters (both uppercase and lowercase),
digits and underscores. It also ensures that the name starts with either a letter or an underscore. After
that, any amount of "word" characters can follow.
2. METHOD_DECLARATION = "\\s*void\\s+(?<name>" + NAME + ")\\s*\\([^)]*\\)" + "\\s*\\{"
this regex is used to identify method declarations. It starts by allowing optional whitespace, mandatory void
as dictated by the exercise, then it captures the first part of the expression in a group, and follows is the
method name using the previously defined NAME regex. After that, it allows for optional whitespace, an opening
 parenthesis, any characters that are not a closing parenthesis (to account for parameters), a closing
 parenthesis, optional whitespace, and finally an opening curly brace to signify the start of the method body.

our code's logic, which is contained in the FileProcessor class, takes care of checking the code is legal by
doing 3 passes over the code: first to make sure all the lines end with a legal ending, next to store all our
values and functions, and last to make sure we made legal assignments and uses of our values and functions. in
 our design we decided to create classes for function info and variable info, so that it will be simpler to
 keep track with data structures of the variables and functions we have already seen.
our exception class SjavacException catches all the illegal cases we could think of, and each prints a
different message to help the user understand what went wrong.
